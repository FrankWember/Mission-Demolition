Enhancements
Pressing the escape button opens the pause menu.
The pause menu allows adjustments to Master volume, SoundFX, and Music levels.
Background music has been added to enhance gameplay.
There is a 10% chance of encountering a larger red ball instead of the standard one.
The larger red ball has greater mass and is more effective at breaking walls and slabs.
The game now includes a start menu, a game-over menu, and an about menu for a more polished user interface.
